# Lab-Physics Repo

This repo contains the Python code I wrote for my Lab Physics course taken at Bates College during my sophomore year. I learned to use multiple Python libraries and tools, such as
- matplotlib
- numpy / scipy / pandas
- lmfit
in order to model my data against an equation (e.g., Gaussian, damped harmonic). I also learned to organize data into .csv format for quick / easy analysis.

I will purposefully include all my labs, from #1 to #6, to showcase my growth in my coding ability.

## Table of Contents

- Lab #1 : Finding the speed of sound in different mediums.
- Lab #2 : Finding the mass of the neutron using spectroscopy. *
- Lab #3 : Finding the speed of light using a rotating mirror. *
- Lab #4 : Finding the dielectric constant of air / lab-specific paper using a capacitor.
- Lab #5 : Explored the Free Spectral Range of a 633 nm laser and observed the Zeeman effect.
- Lab #6 : Finding the gravitational constant G using a Cavendish setup. *

Also attached are three lab reports I wrote, indicated by the "*" next to the lab.
